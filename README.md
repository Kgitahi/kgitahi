4. **Strategic Buyout Proposal for Amadeus Global Travel: Team Challenge**:
   I collaborated with a team of four to analyze the potential leveraged buyout (LBO) of Amadeus Global Travel Distribution by BC Partners. My role was to lead the financial analysis, where I evaluated two strategies—geographical expansion and repositioning as an IT solutions provider—using metrics such as revenue growth and profitability. Based on my analysis, I recommended the IT solutions strategy, which projected a 26.40% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and an increase in revenue by €409 million over six years, helping BC Partners maximize their investment.
